                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>My name is Emma and I attend Southeast Tech, majoring in computer programming. I currently work part-time as a 911 dispatcher in Mitchell, SD. </p>

                <h2>My hobbies</h2>
                <p>In my free time I spend my time doing plenty of nerdy activities. Sometimes I like to play cozy video games like Stardew Valley, CoreKeeper, Slime Rancher, etc. Recently I have been learning to play Magic the Gathering. When I'm not spending my time in virtual fantasy worlds I like to divulge myself into books. I like to read fantasy, murder-mystery, memiors, etc. Once in a while I get a little crafty and like to crochet and sew. When I get burnt out you can find me cuddling with my cat Pumba listening to a large menagerie of music.
